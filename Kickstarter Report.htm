<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:107%'>Kickstarter Report</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>                </b>A few conclusions can be made based
on the current data provided. Exhibit <b><span style='color:red'>A</span></b>.
Currently; In the United States, Theatre by far is the single most successful kickstarter
category followed my music coming in at a close second. This seems pretty
reasonable. With a thriving social media population I feel that this has
influenced how people make music and get recognized for their talents. Exhibit <b><span
style='color:red'>B. </span></b><span style='color:black'>Games are coming in
at a close second or third to last. I can predict this will slowly rise over
the next decade due to advancement in technology. Exhibit </span><b><span
style='color:red'>C</span></b><span style='color:black'>. Technology. Pay close
attention to this category in 2019. We might see a slight rise in actual
kickstarts, but I can almost guarantee that we will see an improvement in
percent funded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>                Moving on to
limitations. The only real limitation I see with the data provided is a lack of
understanding how these startups failed. Theres almost always more variable as
to why a company fails other than just the fact that the funds weren’t there.
Maybe there was a lack of talent? Interest? Who knows. But they failed. And
that’s all that matters… Or doesn’t matter?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>                I would personally
create another table and graph stating that – Company failed – Lack of funds – or
other. Or both. You could then start to dig down and make some analysis to
predict where certain country lack certain talents! </span><span
